# Restaurant Management System
Restaurant management system that provides functionalities for user authentication, menu management, staff management, table management, order and invoice management, reviews, and more. It also integrates with Twilio for OTP verification, Redis for caching, RazorPay for payment processing, and Gomail for sending PDF email confirmations.

**Features:**

* **User Authentication:** Create accounts, log in, manage permissions (using the `User` API folder)
* **Menu Management:** Create, add, update, and remove menu items (using the `MenuManagement` API folder)
* **Staff Management:** Add staff information, assign roles, manage schedules (using the `StaffManagement` API folder)
* **Table Management:** Create digital floor plans, assign tables to reservations, track table status (using the `TableManagement` API folder)
* **Order and Invoice Management:** Take orders, generate bills, track order history, generate reports (using the `Order and InvoiceManagement` API folder)
* **Reviews:** View and manage customer reviews (using the `Reviews` API folder)
* **Twilio Integration:** OTP verification for secure user registration/login (refer to Twilio documentation: https://www.twilio.com/docs)
* **Redis Integration:** Caching for improved performance (refer to Redis documentation: https://redis.io/docs)
* **RazorPay Integration:** Secure payment processing (refer to RazorPay documentation: https://razorpay.com/docs/)
* **Gomail Integration:** Sending PDF email confirmations for reservations and invoices (refer to Gomail documentation: https://github.com/gomail/gomail)

**Dependencies:**

* This project may require additional dependencies for the integrated functionalities depending on your chosen backend language.
* Common dependencies may include:
    - Twilio SDK for your backend language
    - Redis client library for your backend language
    - RazorPay SDK for your backend language
    - Gomail library for your backend language (Go)

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required dependencies (instructions specific to your chosen backend language will be needed).
3. Configure API endpoints using the provided Postman collection (https://crimson-comet-763802.postman.co/workspace/New-Team-Workspace~327f369a-ed37-4ff2-8608-36ed8ca83f48/collection/32047362-dfdc072d-68e8-4295-bc38-1112697c2f21?action=share&creator=32047362&active-environment=32047362-6b673c51-01d5-493f-b2f0-0fedaa8508dc).
4. Configure Twilio account credentials (Account SID, Auth Token).
5. Configure Redis server connection details.
6. Configure RazorPay account credentials (API keys).
7. Configure Gomail for email sending (SMTP server details, sender email address).
8. Run the application (instructions specific to your chosen backend language will be needed).

**Security:**

* Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for user access and API interactions.
* Use HTTPS for secure communication between your application and external services.
* Refer to the security documentation of each integrated service for further recommendations.

**Testing:**

* Thoroughly test all functionalities with various scenarios (successful login, failed payments, etc.).
* Implement unit tests for critical code sections.

**Contributing:**

* Pull requests and suggestions are welcome!

**Note:**

* This README is a general guide. Specific implementation instructions may vary depending on your chosen backend language, libraries, and the provided Postman collection for API interactions.
* For detailed instructions on integrating external services (Twilio, Redis, RazorPay, Gomail), refer to their respective documentation.

I hope this README provides a clear overview of your project and assists you in setting it up effectively!
